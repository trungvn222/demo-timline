The software team works on many tasks, each was estimated with some timelines, represented as (start_time, end_time) pairs. Write an app to display these timeline segments such that no segment should overlap.
Segments with overlapping timelines should be displayed in different rows. Segments with earlier starting times should be displayed in higher rows, for segments with the same starting times, ones with earlier end times should be displayed on higher rows.

Sample data: sampleData.js
Expected output for sample data: timeSegmentsNums.png
